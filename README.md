To celebrate the launch of the new film A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon, we have teamed up with Shaun the Sheep and his new alien friend Lu-La to bring you an exciting new global Code Club competition!

We at Youth Coding and Innovation Club, are proud to participate the global code competition (hosted by CodeClub) in the second year, this year, we will have two entries, one from Annie Tian (New York), and one from Frank Kan (California).

We are looking forward to see more students to participate in the future.
